# Minecraft_Effekseer_Implementation Unofficial 1.7.10 Backport
An attempt to backport Minecraft_Effekseer_Implementation to minecraft forge 1.7.10. I fixed all compile-time and some runtime crashes, however I have encountered native JVM crashes and have no idea how to fix them. This mod will not work as is, but it is there in case someone wants to pick up where I left off.
