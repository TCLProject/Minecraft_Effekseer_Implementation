# Minecraft_Effekseer_Implementation Unofficial 1.7.10 Backport
An attempt to backport Minecraft_Effekseer_Implementation by GiantLuigi to minecraft forge 1.7.10. I fixed all compile-time and some runtime crashes and backported most of the mod. This mod will not work as is, but it is there in case someone wants to pick up where I left off.
